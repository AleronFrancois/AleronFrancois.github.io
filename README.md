            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Passionate about computer science and cybersecurity, always eager to explore innovative 
            technologies and solve complex problems. I graduated from the University of Tasmania with a
            Diploma of ICT in the class of 2024, where I built a strong foundation in tech. I am currently
            studying the Bachelor of ICT with a major in Networks and Cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Beyond academics, Iâ€™ve developed strong teamwork and communication skills through playing 
            and coaching American football and state-league volleyball, where I have won several awards.
            These transferable skills assist me when teaching or explaining complexities to others, 
            taking into consideration their understanding level, which others have greatly appreciated.</p>
